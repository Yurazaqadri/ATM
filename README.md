# ATM
Crafted a secure and object-oriented ATM system in Java, integrating robust OOP principles and security concepts for a reliable financial transaction experience.
The "ATM Simulator" project is a comprehensive Java-based application designed to emulate the functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). Leveraging Java's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and incorporating secure database interactions with MySQL using JDBC, the project encompasses a well-structured and modular codebase. The frontend is developed using the Swing framework to ensure a user-friendly interface. The implementation adheres to coding standards, emphasizes clean code practices, and integrates key data structures and algorithms from CS608 for optimal performance.

The project's lifecycle begins with meticulous project planning and design, focusing on accurate interpretation of requirements, coherent system design, and identification of use cases. The development phase includes adherence to coding standards, smooth implementation of ATM features, robust error handling, and comprehensive code documentation. Testing strategies cover a thorough test plan, detailed test case creation and execution, and efficient bug identification and resolution.

During the presentation and demo phase, the team emphasizes clarity of explanation, showcasing key features, and addressing questions with confidence. The collaborative aspect of the project highlights effective communication, equitable distribution of tasks, and conflict resolution within the team. Individual contributions are assessed based on successful completion of assigned tasks, the quality of work, active participation in group discussions, and supportiveness towards team members.

Furthermore, the integration of CS608 Algorithms into the development code ensures that the project incorporates advanced algorithms for enhanced efficiency. The reflection component allows participants to demonstrate understanding and insight into the project's development and challenges, as well as articulate how the learnings can be applied in future projects. Overall, this project provides a holistic evaluation framework, ensuring a fair and comprehensive assessment of both group and individual contributions.
